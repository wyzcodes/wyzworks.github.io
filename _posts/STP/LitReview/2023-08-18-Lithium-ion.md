## Highlights
* Evolution of knowledge in the lithium-ion battery industry 
* Emergence of electric vehicles accompanies a discontinuity in the knowledge trajectory 
* New use environments can affect knowledge positions of incumbents and new firms 

# RQ 
Do new use environments also allow new actors to become active in the key knowledge trajectory?

## Data
* EPO PATSTAT  
	* lithium-ion batteries filed globally from 1970-2018
	* Include only the subclassification codes : H01M 4/13*, H01M 4/405, H01M 4/382, H01M 4/36, H01M 4/62, H01M 4/04, H01M 4/64, H01M 4/90, H01M 4/96, H01M 2300, H01M 2*, H01M 10/058*, H01M 10/04, H01M 10/42, H01M 10/052, H01M 2200*, and H01M 10/60,
	* 101,620 patent families and 543,930 citations

## Methodology
Search path link count (SPLC) algorithm to assign weights to nodes(patents) and links(citations) in the network (ref: [Huenteler et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733321001190#bib0044); [Verspagen, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733321001190#bib0081))  
Only included citation with time lag between the dayte of publication and  date of application less than 5 years to avoid excessive weight to older patents ( ref: [Nemet and Johnson, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733321001190#bib0060))
